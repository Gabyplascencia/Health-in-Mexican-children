# Health-in-Mexican-children
Given the problems that have arisen in recent decades and the rise of Mexico to the top spot in childhood obesity worldwide among children ages 5 to 11.

Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem, with nearly 37% of children ages 5 to 11 in Mexico suffering from overweight or obesity.

This research seeks to understand how factors such as diet and lack of physical activity are impacting our children and exacerbating this health problem in Mexico.

## 🏁Objetive
To identify patterns between food consumption and nutritional status (obesity or malnutrition) in Mexican children, using clean data and exploratory analysis.

## 🖥Technologies used
Python : Pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook : entorno interactivo para análisis.
Conjunto de datos CSV : contiene datos sobre el comportamiento del usuario.

## 🔑Key steps
1. Data Loading and Cleaning

    Three datasets were integrated: diet, physical activity, and childhood anthropometry.

    Duplicates were removed, columns were renamed, and units were normalized to facilitate cross-analysis.

2. Exploratory Analysis (EDA)

    Key variables such as BMI, food group consumption, and physical activity levels were analyzed.

    Outliers were identified, and graphs were generated to understand age and gender distribution.

3. Nutritional Status Categorization

    BMI was calculated, and children were classified into categories of malnutrition, normal weight, overweight, and obesity according to pediatric parameters.

    Consumption categories were created: high, medium, and low for each food group.

4. Key Variable Cross-References

    Associations were explored between malnutrition (obesity and undernutrition) and factors such as low fruit and vegetable consumption, excess sugar or fat, and insufficient physical activity.

5. Visualizations

    Graphs were generated, including the top 10 most consumed foods, BMI vs. physical activity dispersion, and correlation heat maps.

6. Conclusions

## 🥇🏆Results
The analysis confirms that:

🔴 Thirty percent of children with low fruit and vegetable consumption were obese.

🟢 Children with high levels of physical activity had a lower prevalence of obesity (10%) and a higher proportion of normal weight.

⚠️ High sugar consumption was associated with an increased risk of being overweight, especially in children under 10 years of age.

🟡 18% of children with low total energy intake showed signs of malnutrition.
